# Page To Palate

Hello and welcome to Page to Palate!

This project started from a simple, relatable problem in my own family: my mom loves to collect and write down recipes, but she often misplaces the recipe books. I wanted to create a solution that would not only solve this problem for her but also provide a beautiful and easy way for anyone to store and share their favorite recipes online.

What is Page to Palate?
At its core, Page to Palate is an online recipe book. But it's more than just a place to find recipes; it's a place to create, save, and cherish them. It's built for everyone, from the experienced home chef to the new baker.

Key Features
Public Recipe Library: Browse and discover a wide variety of recipes submitted by other users.

Add Your Own Recipes: Easily upload and format your favorite recipes.

Privacy Controls: This is a big one. You can choose to make your recipes public for the community to see or keep them in a private collection, perfect for those family secret recipes you don't want to lose!

Intuitive Interface: The design is clean and simple, making it easy to navigate whether you're looking for a new dinner idea or adding your grandmother's famous cookie recipe.

How It Works
Page to Palate is built on HTML, JavaScript, CSS, TheMeal Database API. When you add a recipe, it's stored in a database and can be retrieved and displayed based on your privacy settings. The user interface is designed to make the experience of adding and viewing recipes as smooth as possible.

This project was a labor of love, and I'm so excited to finally share it with you all. I hope it brings as much joy to others as it has to my family.
